### Resources 

I'd like to thank all the people offering to the DIY community and link some resources that helped me get familiar with designing pcb's.

Jeremy Blum's [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sciguy14) has some good tutorials for EAGLE basics.

Effect's Layout [blog](http://effectslayouts.blogspot.com/) / [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuCJhqsyaGveg0PjLbAGcdQ) has a big variety of pedal designs for perfboards / pcb etching. Also a nice tutorial series for EAGLE and a pack of EAGLE libraries with focus to pcb design for pedals. 

[MadBeanPedals](https://www.madbeanpedals.com/) has some designs and tutorials for homemade pcb etching. He also has a very helpful EAGLE library.
